## Requirements

Python 2.7, PyTorch >=0.3.0, Gensim >= 0.12.0

## Data format
For the data format used in our implementation, please read this [issue](https://github.com/XuezheMax/NeuroNLP2/issues/9).

## Running the experiments

### Sequence labeling
In the root of the repository, first make the tmp directory:

    mkdir tmp

To train a CRF POS tagger, 

    ./example/run_posCRFTagger.sh
where the arguments for ```train/dev/test``` data, together with the pretrained word embedding should be setup.

To train a NER model,

    ./example/run_ner_crf.sh

#### Note
If you want to apply the sequence labeling model to other tasks or different datasets, please be sure to remove the corresponding folders storing the vocabularies located in ```data/alphabets/```. Otherwise, the old vocabularies will be loaded from disk.

### Dependency Parsing
To train a Stack-Pointer parser, simply run

    ./example/run_stackPtrParser.sh
Remeber to setup the paths for data and embeddings.

To train a Deep BiAffine parser, simply run

    ./example/run_graphParser.sh
Again, remember to setup the paths for data and embeddings.

To train a Neural MST parser, run the same script, but change the argument ```objective``` from ```cross_entropy``` to ```crf``` (this part is still under development).
